            <h3>Short Bio</h3>
            <p>
                I'm Adetola Beloved, a computer science student and front-end developer passionate about crafting

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                My primary goal for this program is to sharpen my frontend development skills, improve collaboration

            <h3>Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
            <p>
                While I'm confident in my coding fundamentals, I still find performance optimization and accessibility
                testing challenging. But I'm determined to get better through consistent learning.

            <h3>Note to My Future Self</h3>
            <p>
                Keep your curiosity alive, keep experimenting, and never stop building. Every bug fixed today is a
                foundation for tomorrow's breakthroughs.

                Building products that improve people's daily lives excites me — whether that's through automation,
                better UI, or just a smoother experience online.
